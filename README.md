Introduction
============

*Roto Game* is a puzzle game inspired by 70s bathroom tiles.

Play at: [rotogame.appspot.com][1] (see also related [Chrome Experiment][2])

There is a variant of Roto Game with squared tiles, [ROTOGAMEsq][3]. Source
code is available on [GitHub][4].


Development
===========

Getting started
---------------

  * To enable debug mode, edit `/main.py`:

        debug = True

    Debug mode should be disabled before deploying the application.

  * For initializing the database, browse the following URL path, relative to
    the root URL of the project. This functionality is only available in debug
    mode. Beware: This may delete existing data, e.g. entries in the top
    players lists.

        /admin/update


Conventions
-----------

  * Coordinates in *piece space* are measured in piece positions on the board.
    The left most piece position is 0, the second left mose is 1, etc..

  * Coordinates and dimensions in piece space are usually postfixed by the
    letter `p` (upper or lower case).


Deployment
----------

  * Follow the instructions below to create a so called custom Dojo build,
    located in:

        /javascript/dojotoolkit

    One reason for using a custom build is that there is a [bug][5] which
    affects FF3, which Felix experienced in 2009 when connected via T-Mobile
    Germany UMTS.

    In a nutshell, it seems that Dojo requires to be evaluated before some
    initialization is finished. For example, Felix saw FF3 requesting the
    following invalid resource:

        http://rotogame.appspot.com/games/undefined../dojox/gfx.js

    How to create the build, which is usually only necessary after an update of
    Dojo:

     1. Run the following command in the dojo "buildscripts" directory:

            build.bat profile=rotogame action=clean,release optimize=shrinksafe

        Location of that directory ($version is the Dojo version number):

            /source/dojo-release-$version-src/util/buildscripts

        The resulting build is located in:

            /source/dojo-release-$version-src/release

      2. Update the files in, using the newly built versions:

             /javascript/dojotoolkit/dojo

  * Tasks recommended before deployment:

      + Validate HTML.

      + Test with popular browsers: Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, IE6, IE7,
        IE8

      + Test with images turned off in Firefox.

      + Test with JavaScript turned off in Firefox.

      + Test via a mobile connection (with image compression) with IE8 and
        Firefox.


Images
------

GIF images exported from XARA should have transparency set. Otherwise, when
viewed via a T-Mobile Germany UMTS connection with image compression, some
unwanted color may turn transparent (as of June 2009).
