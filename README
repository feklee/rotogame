Introduction
============

Information relevant to development of Roto Game, a web based game that runs on
Google App Engine.


Getting started
===============

* To enable debug mode, edit "/main.py":

    debug = True

  Debug mode should be disabled before deploying the application.

* For initializing the database, browse the following URL path, relative to the
  root URL of the project. This functionality is only available in debug mode.
  Beware: This may delete existing data, e.g. entries in the top players lists.

    /admin/update


Conventions
===========

* Coordinates in "piece space" are measured in piece positions on the board.
  The left most piece position is 0, the second left mose is 1, etc..

* Coordinates and dimensions in "piece space" are usually postfixed by the
  letter p (upper or lower case).


Deployment
==========

* Follow the instructions below to create a so called custom Dojo build,
  located in:

    /javascript/dojotoolkit

  One reason for using a custom build is that there is a bug which affects FF3,
  which Felix experienced in 2009 when connected via T-Mobile Germany UMTS:
  
    <http://www.dojotoolkit.com/forum/dojo-foundation/general-discussion/
    firefox-3-fires-domcontentloaded-event-prematurely>

  In a nutshell, it seems that Dojo requires seem to be evaluated before some
  initialization is finished. For example, Felix saw FF3 requesting the
  following invalid resource:
  
    http://rotogame.appspot.com/games/undefined../dojox/gfx.js
  
  How to create the build:

  1. Run the following command in the dojo "buildscripts" directory:

      build.bat profile=rotogame action=clean,release optimize=shrinksafe

    Location of that directory:

      /source/dojo-release-1.3.0-src/util/buildscripts

    The resulting build is located in:

      /source/dojo-release-1.3.0-src/release
  
  2. Update at least the file "rotogame.js" in the directory
    "/javascript/dojotoolkit/dojo", and maybe also the file "dojo.js" in the
    same directory.

* Tasks recommended before deployment:

  - Validate HTML.

  - Test with popular browsers: Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, IE6, IE7, IE8

  - Test with images turned off in Firefox.

  - Test with JavaScript turned off in Firefox.
  
  - Test via a mobile connection (with image compression) with IE8 and Firefox.

  
Images
======

GIF images exported from XARA should have transparency set. Otherwise, when
viewed via a T-Mobile Germany UMTS connection with image compression, some
unwanted color may turn transparent (as of 2009-June).
